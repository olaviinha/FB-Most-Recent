# FBMostRecent
Chrome Extension that does nothing but permanently switches Facebook's News Feed from "Top Stories" to "Most Recent". Technically it only replaces any link in facebook.com with `href="/"` with `href="/?sk=h_chr"` on click.

## Howto

1. Clone this repository (or download files into a directory)
2. In Chrome, go to address `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable _Developer mode_ from upper right corner.
4. Click the _Load Unpacked_ button and select the directory (e.g. `FBMostRecent`) where the files are located.
